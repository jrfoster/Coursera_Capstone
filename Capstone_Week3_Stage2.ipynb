    "The main goal of the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project is to compare various neighborhoods in Toronto, Ontario, CA by exploring them using location data, segmenting them into similar clusters and comparing them based on various aspects such as the services they might provide, or potentially why certain venues are popular or possibly, why people complain about certain venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the second 'stage' of the capstone project. It contains the code to obtain the neighborhood data as well as code to geocode all those neighborhoods so we can utilize the location data provider Foursquare.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining Neighborhood Data\n",
    "Unlike other cities, like New York, Toronto's neighborhood data is not readily available on the Internet in a directly consumable format. However, for this data, a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M) exists that contains data we can use to divide the city into boroughs and neighborhoods.\n",

    "First, we get our imports in place. We are using `Pandas`, as well as `Requests` to scrape the page and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing the resulting HTML."

    "There are a few options available for obtaining latitude and longitude for postal codes. The most reliable option would be the Google Maps API, which provides highly efficient geocoding services, but is no longer free of charge. There is also a Python package called `Geocoder` that utilizes myriad other services, (e.g. ArcGIS, Baidu, Bing, Geocoder.ca, MapQuest, et al) to perform geocoding. One problem with this package, though, is that many times a call to it will return `None`, and so we have to try the call many times, to obtain latitude and longitude, and sometimes we cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the cost associated with Google Maps API and the non-deterministic behavior of `Geocoder` I have chosen to use the text file made available for the capstone project that contains pre-geocoded postal codes, located [here](http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code will read the file from the given location into a DataFrame and then inner join it to the neighborhood DataFrame on postal code. Some care is taken to ensure that the join is truly one-to-one and that each postal code exists in both DataFrames. The resulting DataFrame should have the same 103 rows as before and all rows should have the indicator listed as both (e.g. `_merge == 'both'`). Finally the duplicated join column and the indicator column `_merge` are dropped."
